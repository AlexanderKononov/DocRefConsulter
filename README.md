# DocRefConsulter
The browser extension for patients which help to evaluate, filtrate and consider sites, links and other available sources with medical and disease-associated information.
To hear any serious diagnosis can be a very stressful and frustrating experience. The program is aimed to support such people and help them to orientate within overwhelming information flow which becomes as scary as dramatically important for a patient.

### Description
Within the frame of DayOne Health Hack (Hackaton event)(https://2020.healthhack.solutions/) we decided to focus on challenge **Trusted By Patients-Method** 

By the DocRefConsulter project, we plan to develop an extension for a browser which will dynamically analyse the visited site and links in the content of a page and give the trust rating of this resources and available short recommendation.
We assume to create two key features for the program: a rating system and curated trust labels.
We plan to create the list of trusted info source as well as resources for patient support and communication. However, it is hard to maintain and it quit inertial decision. That is why the crucial app feature is a rating system. The extension will dynamically show the community evaluation of current source and ask a user to estimate the source.

### Plans
We plan to do the first MVP (Minimum Viable Product) as the button on the browser panel which opens the small additional window with information about the currently active browser tab and a small poll form for community evaluation.
Then we go to the form of the app which labelled the search results by small marks near to the links and a pop-up poll forms to engage users to estimate resources after visiting ons. It can be illustrated as who antivirus browser extensions which markers the search results by different trust criteria. The other important direction to improv is a system of evaluation, evaluated characteristic and set of implemented labels and markers and it will modify along the process of development and testing.
